# public-well
Some R scripts I wrote when I first started learning to code-- aiming towards public wellness

None of these were big projects. I was just trying to learn R by writing R code.

The most thought-out stuff is the CongressAPI (learning Propublica's API and moving historical Congress data around), the IntroDistancesProject (learning Google Map's Distance API), adn the everyday script (some functions and options I thought would be helpful day-to-day).

This repository was previously private, since I felt that the outdated code wasn't worth posting. But making public, now, for some samples of little projects I started when I was first learning.
